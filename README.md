# Populartimes  
The goal of this library is to provide an option to use *Google Maps* popular times data, until it is available via Google's API. 
For legal concerns please read [Issue #90](../../issues/90). 

Keep in mind that this API uses the Google Places Web Service, where each API call over a monthly budget is priced. 
As of February 2018, you can make 5000 calls with the allotted monthly budget. 
For more information check https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/usage-and-billing and https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/#places.  

As Google Maps is constantly updated this library can  be unstable.

## How to get started
+ Get a Google Maps API key https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key 
+ `clone` the repository, `cd` into the populartimes directory and run `pip install .`
+ Alternatively install directly from github using `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes`
+ `import populartimes` and run with `populartimes.get(...)` or `populartimes.get_id(...)`
 + **Note**: The library is not available via PyPI, so you have to clone/download the repository and install it locally.

## populartimes.get_id(...)
Retrieves information for a given place id and adds populartimes, wait, time_spent and other data not accessible via Google Places.

+ **populartimes.get_id**(api_key, place_id)
    + **api_key** str; api key from google places web service; e.g. "your-api-key"
    + **place_id** str; unique google maps id; retrievable via populartimes.get() or https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-placeid-finder

+ **Example call**
    + populartimes.get_id("your-api-key", "ChIJSYuuSx9awokRyrrOFTGg0GY")

+ **Response**
    + The response is formatted is equal to the .json described below.
    + The information present for places is highly varying. Therefore *popularity*, *current_popularity*, *rating*, *rating_n*, *time_wait*, *time_spent* and *phone* are optional return parameters and only present if available.
    + *time_wait* and *time_spent* are in minutes
    + **Note**: The *time_wait* and *time_spent* parameters were only added recently to Google Maps and are only present as a language specific string. The extracted values may therefore be incorrect and you might have to parse the raw string yourself, depending on your language settings.

## populartimes.get(...) - REMOVED

Has been removed, as this used the **Google Places Nearby Search** endpoint which is expensive 
(refer to https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search#PlaceSearchRequests) and the places API does not support covering a specified area itself.

Please implement your own covering algorithm to get all place IDs that you're interested in and call ````get_id()````.
If you want to used the ````get()```` call please checkout a previous version and use it at your own caution 
(be aware that there have been cases where this lead to a high amount of API requests, which were billed by Google Maps).
